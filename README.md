## Running Tests

1. Install the testing dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

   The tests will check the functionality of all endpoints and ensure the API behaves as expected. 


3. Run pytest-cov:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

   The test-coverage will check the tests-coverage of the app-files

Terminal outcome example:

---------- coverage: platform darwin, python 3.12.3-final-0 ----------
Name                            Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing

app/core/__init__.py                0      0   100%
app/core/database.py               18     18     0%   2-36
-------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                              18     18    66%

The file app/core/database does not run when the test-file runs.
Underneath missing, all the not tested lines in that file are named.
